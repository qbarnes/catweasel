cw-0.09-20060110
	* new option: -s
	* changed configuration for c1541, c1541_40, c1571 and c1571_40,
	  disks written with version 0.08 may cause read errors in
	  original C1541 and C1571 drives, because the heads are thicker
	  and are also influenced by data between the tracks (one track
	  on C1541/C1571 drives are two tracks in 5.25" HD drives), when
	  writing such disks the tracks inbetween are now cleared,
	  furthermore other timings are used
	* corrected track numbering for c1571, but i do not own a C1571 so
	  i could not test if it works now correctly
